# 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Using Python  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes Zomato's restaurant data to uncover key insights about restaurant ratings, customer preferences, cuisine trends, and pricing strategies. Using **Python**, we perform **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to extract meaningful patterns from the dataset.  

## 💁️ Dataset  
- The dataset contains restaurant details such as name, location, ratings, price range, cuisine types, and more.  
- Pre-processing includes handling missing values, cleaning ratings, and removing irrelevant or duplicate data.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis  

## 📊 Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Loading:** Importing the Zomato dataset using Pandas.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and converting ratings into numeric format.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzing restaurant types, locations, and cuisines.  
   - Finding trends in customer ratings and price ranges.  
   - Correlation between price and restaurant rating.  
4. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Distribution of ratings using histograms.  
   - Popular cuisines in different cities.  
   - Heatmaps to visualize correlations.  

## 📈 Key Insights  
✔️ Top-rated restaurants and their characteristics  
✔️ Most popular cuisines in different locations  
✔️ Relationship between price range and ratings  
✔️ Distribution of restaurant types across cities  

## 🏆 Future Enhancements  
- Implement sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews.  
- Predict restaurant success using machine learning models.  
- Integrate real-time data scraping from Zomato API.  

## 📝 Conclusion  
This project provided valuable insights into Zomato restaurant data by analyzing trends in ratings, pricing, and cuisines. The findings can help businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize pricing strategies. Further improvements, such as incorporating machine learning models and real-time data updates, can make the analysis more dynamic and actionable.
